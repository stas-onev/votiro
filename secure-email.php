					</div>
					<div class="column tpg">
						<p>The email channel of business communication has increasingly gained popularity among cybercriminals and is today one of the most common targets for malicious attacks such as identity theft, banking scams, spear phishing, zero-day, and ransomware.</p>
						<p>The most sophisticated among these malicious cyber-attacks are those that bypass most security barriers under the radar, leaving enterprises in their most vulnerable state: unaware and therefore, unprotected.</p>
						<p>The File Disarmer provides the most advanced email protection available today against undisclosed threats. Easily integrated with every other security defense, the File Disarmer sanitizes your email and attachments from any known or unknown malware that other systems fail to detect, ensuring a safe use within less than 1 second.</p>
