			<p><strong>Digitalizing bureaucracy comes with a great risk of malware penetration and spread within government agencies</strong></p>
			<p>From tax authorities to transport agencies, through local municipalities to immigration offices – government agencies provide the most basic and vital services to citizens around the world. And, although not yet at the forefront of digital transformation, more and more government services and processes are being done online, relieving the citizens of long queues, traffic jams and lost working hours. Processes such as fine payments, driving license renewal, passport issuing, taxes payments, certificates of approval from other agencies, and so many more, are mostly done online through the upload and download, sharing and sending of ID copies, picture scans, e-forms, et cetera.</p>
			<p>However, along with growing efficiency and improvement in services, digitalizing standard bureaucratic processes comes with a price – the more digital access external users get, the more breach points into the organization, and government agencies in the age of digital services find themselves exposed to the most sophisticated types of document-borne attacks penetrating every standard security scan.</p>
